# MovieSentimentPrediction
This Kaggle project, featured on my Kaggle profile, focuses on sentiment prediction based on movie reviews.
Instead of relying on the more intricate models available in the NLP library, the primary goal of this project was to showcase the effectiveness of basic Machine Learning Models.
It also aimed to emphasize the significance of preprocessing and feature engineering, including statistical approaches to enhance data suitability. 
In essence, this project prioritized model interpretability and aimed to provide insights into the inner workings of the models, in contrast to using more opaque "black box" models.
To achieve this, we conducted performance comparisons among various ML models.
